## Analysis of Purchase and Demographic Data

Although the game is still developing with a small playerbase of just under 600 players (576) the audience is surprisingly diverse. While males dominate the percentage of users coming in at 84 players, they make up nearly 85% of the playerbase, the game is starting out with over 15% of players between females and those who would rather not disclose. This might be a great indicator of the game's overall appeal to consumers and its marketability within larger audience targets. 

Interestingly enough, the data shows that the female and other gendered players both had a higher likelyhood of purchasing in-game items when compared to males, so perhaps it would be profitable to market the game to women and non-binary gamers as the game expands an seeks to draw in a larger playerbase. 

Another point to consider is that the majority of players are betweem ages 20 and 24- an age demographic that has an average purchase price per person of $4.32 which isn't the highest average, but across nearly half of the playerbase, it is a noteworthy figure that in my opinion should be considered for targeted advertisement and marketing campaigns.
